# Trust Framework

Trust tiers and verification for agent-ready sites in the Autonomica directory.

## Trust Tiers

### New
Default tier for newly discovered sites. Probed but not yet assessed.

### Established
Sites that have maintained consistent agent-facing content over time. Probe history shows reliability.

### Verified
Sites where the publisher has claimed ownership and verified their identity.

### Claimed
Sites where the publisher actively manages their directory listing and responds to quality assessments.

## Signals That Reduce Trust
